# React-SSR
Server Side React

This Projects aims at creating a Server Side Rendered React App . You can name it like Universal React, Isomorphic React, SSR etc.
Let's not get into the naming confusion .

## Inspiration
Aiming at creating a boilerplate code with all the recent trends in Web App Development. I will not get into details of why use 
SSR, as there are a lot a material out there. One which i feel gives a detailed picture from where i learned some minor details
was this <a href = "https://medium.com/walmartlabs/the-benefits-of-server-side-rendering-over-client-side-rendering-5d07ff2cefe8">awesome medium link</a>
